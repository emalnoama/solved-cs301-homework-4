Problem 1 Consider a variation of the Longest Common Subsequence (LCS) problem where <em>k </em>(<em>k &gt; </em>2) sequences are given as input and the goal is to find their LCS.

<ul>

 <li>How would you modify the recursive formula and the top-down LCS algorithm that we have studied in class for two sequences, to find an LCS for <em>k </em>sequences? Please explain.</li>

 <li>What is the asymptotic time complexity of your algorithm? Please discuss: isit expected or a surprise?</li>

</ul>

Problem 2 Given a tree (<em>V,E</em>), design an algorithm using dynamic programming to find a minimum cardinality set <em>X </em>⊆ <em>V </em>of vertices such that the following holds: for every edge {<em>u,v</em>}∈ <em>E</em>, <em>u </em>∈ <em>X </em>or <em>v </em>∈ <em>X</em>.

<ul>

 <li>Please describe how you design your algorithm (i.e., optimal substructures,recursive solution, construction of solution, etc.), and include a pseudocode of your algorithm.</li>

 <li>Analyze the asymptotic time complexity of your algorithm.</li>

 <li>How does the computational complexity of this problem change, if a graph isgiven as an input instead of a tree? Please discuss.</li>

</ul>

Problem 3 (a) Define the Minimum Leaf Spanning Tree (MLST) problem: What are the input and the output?

<ul>

 <li>Describe a real-world application of MLST.</li>

 <li>Prove that MLST is NP-complete.</li>

</ul>
